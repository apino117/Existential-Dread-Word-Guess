# Word-Guess-Game

Welcome to Existential Dread Hangman, the world's leading dread-based word game! Everything's feels so okay!

Every round you'll have a set of blank spaces that will eventually fill out for a full word which follows in our theme.

Dread-Man - as the kids call it - is not for kids. These are heavy concepts suitable for no one under the age of 18.

Dread-man's goal is to just be totally fine and everything's going to be okay.

To get started, open it up and dont worry about what will happen afterwards!

If at anypoint you need help please rest assured by the time help arrives it won't matter. That warm feeling is them coming.
