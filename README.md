# Word-Guess-Game

Welcome to Khraung-Man, the world's first Khraungbin based hangman game! It's not a trivia game (because nobody knows who Khraungbin is) it's actually a game designed to teach you about one of America's dopest and most fresh trio of musicans! Ready to learn?

Every round you'll have a set of blank spaces that will eventually fill out for a full word. That word will be the answer to a question about Khraunbin, don't worry - it's stuff anyone would know!

Khruang-Man - just like the music - is for everyone! The universe smiles upon you and your extended family!

Khraung-Man's goal is to educate the world to the growing dopeness of Khraungbin.

To get started, open it up and read those instruct-o's!

If at anypoint you need help please contact us by googling Khraungbin and listening to their music, at which point you'll realize the answers you sought were inside you all along.
